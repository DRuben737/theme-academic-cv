    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Deshuai "Ruben" Ren is a dual-rated Gold Seal Flight Instructor, specializing in both helicopter and airplane instruction. He holds FAA certifications as a CFII for both rotorcraft and fixed-wing aircraft, as well as AGI, IGI, and Remote Pilot ratings.

Ruben began his teaching career as a helicopter instructor in 2021, and later expanded into fixed-wing instruction with a strong emphasis on instrument training. He has trained students in both English and Mandarin, and has a passion for safety-focused, judgment-based flight education.

Currently based in Portland, Oregon, Ruben provides a range of services including time building, discovery flights, IPCs, and flight reviews. In addition to flight training, he also develops web-based aviation tools through his project [PilotSeal.com](https://www.pilotseal.com), aiming to enhance preflight safety and instructional efficiency.

He believes good instruction builds not only skill, but also confidence, humility, and decision-making discipline—qualities essential for every safe pilot.
