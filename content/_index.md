        I am a certified flight instructor (CFII-A/H) and a proud member of the National Association of Flight Instructors (NAFI). My mission is to inspire and train the next generation of pilots by combining rigorous instruction with real-world flight experience. I currently provide both helicopter and fixed-wing training in the Portland, OR area. You can learn more about my flight services at [pilotseal.com](https://pilotseal.com).

        I am passionate about safety, mentorship, and helping each student reach their full potential in aviation. Let's fly safe, and fly well.
